	I reckon "Patience makes perfect", is the one I'll have the most trouble with. I sometimes have a hard time with things not being perfect, or as good as they can be. I'll combine my perfectionism with my procrastination and just completely put something off -- because I know I can't make it perfect. It's a very viscious cycle that has been with me all my life. Recently however, I've been able to combat that with "Just go". I was scared to start exercising, because I wouldn't be perfect right at the beginning. I just went. I was scared to hop into secondary education cause I might look uninformed / dumb. I just went. I'll be able to combat my perfectionism and procrastination by continuing my "just go" attitude.
